Use snowball discussion to debate:\\nPresent an idea or question and have students in pairs, discuss their views. Then have 2 pairs join together to make a group of four and discuss again. The goal is to expose students to many different views while defending their own view or finding logical holes in their peers’ arguments. This works best with controversial issues – not one-sided arguments.\\n\\n2. Use snowball discussion as an ice-breaker:\\nCome up with some interesting ice-breaker questions: What would you do with $10,000,000? If you could have 1 superpower, what would it be? etc. Pose questions to students and have them think-pair-share. Then have the pairs form groups of 4’s and discuss their responses to the questions.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":25}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":670,"height":341,"strokewidth":0}},"width":670,"height":341,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6HcMLVETi2W"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
